        <p>
          I&apos;m a 23-year-old currently studying for a MSc in Games
          Technology at the IT-University of Copenhagen. When I&apos;m not
          hitting the books at my study, you can find me helping others as a
          Teaching Assistant in web development or working as a barista in our
          local student-driven Café Analog. 📖🧑‍🏫☕
          <br /> <br />I have a degree in Software Development where I wrote my
          bachelor focusing on Computaional Storage, which essentaily improves
          performance by doing data operations directly where the data resides.

          As a Software Developer, I&apos;ve &apos;developed&apos;{" "}
          <em>(pun intended) </em>
          strong communication and social skills which have benefitted me
          tremoundelsy in projects with developers and when communicating with
          stakeholders and product owners. I have a natural affinity for
          understanding the greater context of projects, and use that to drive
          up my enthusiasm and intrinsic motivation. I thrive in teamwork where
          I can exercise a balance of optimism and critical thinking while
          learning from my coworkers. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑💭🧑‍💻
          <br /> <br />
          As for hobbies I&apos;m heavily invested in video games and their
          technological aspects, be it the sophisticated AI used or how game
          engines are created. I like to participate in game jams where I can
          hone my creativity when coding in a team of passionate people in the
          quest of creating a mininmum viable product in the form of a
          experimental game. 👾🕹️📜
